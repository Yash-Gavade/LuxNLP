# 🇱🇺 LuxNLP

LuxNLP focuses on improving **Luxembourgish Named Entity Recognition (NER)** and related NLP resources.  
Because Luxembourgish is a low-resource language, our goal is to **collect, clean, and compare data** from **Wikidata** and existing NER datasets to build stronger, more complete models with an extended dataset.

## 🧠 Project Goal

- Scrape and extract **Luxembourgish metadata** from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page)  
- Clean and filter entity data (people, places, organizations, dates)  
- Compare with existing Luxembourgish NER datasets  
- Fine-tune and evaluate **LuxBERT / NER-BERT** on the merged data  
- Save and publish cleaned data and baseline results in this repository
